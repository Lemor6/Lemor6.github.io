      After completing project 1 on wikihow.com, I discovered how easily it is to get caught out on 'potential copyright violation'. As my chosen text 'A Day in the life of a Musician'by Erik Satie was taken from UbuWeb, I know that it copyright has expired or is non-existant. Apparently its not the same case with the wikipedia page that posted this text. Anyway, below I have recreated the Wikihow page that was once to be. Enjoy.

      My only nourishment consists of food that is white: eggs, sugar, shredded bones, the fat of dead animals, veal, salt, coco-nuts, chicken cooked in white water, mouldy fruit, rice, turnips, sausages in camphor, pastry, cheese (white varieties), cotton salad, and certain kinds of fish (without their skin).

    <h2>
      11.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I have a good appetite but never talk when eating for fear of strangling myself.

    <h2>
      12.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I breathe carefully (a little at a time) and dance very rarely. When walking I hold my ribs and look steadily behind me.

    <h2>
      13.
    </h2>

    <p>
      My expression is very serious; when I laugh it is unintentional, and I always apologise very politely.

    <h2>
      14.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I sleep with only one eye closed, very profoundly. My bed is round with a hole in it for my head to go through. Every hour a servant takes my temperature and gives me another.
